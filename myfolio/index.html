          <b>March 2021 – July 2021|</b>
          <b>Intern at ESRI Rwanda</b>
          Worked 3 days a week for the majority of the time on geo mapping and analysing geo data for different projects and one Health Institution using GIS software so that I could balance school and work. During this time I was able to  make a program for a Plastic Surgery clinic to locate past, current and future cleft patients and store info in a map dashboard. This would help them check in on said patients from across the country either directly or through nearby health centers.

          <b>August 2020|</b>
          <b>African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Rwanda (AIMS) – Kigali, Rwanda</b>
          Worked with a team of 7, 6 hours a day and 3 days a week, on finding and implementing ideas to help fund for some necessities that less fortunate students would need.
          We, the team, organized a run that involved 70-100 people to raise awareness to our cause, which was to raise money to buy solar lamps for less fortunate students that are unable to study at night due to electricity and unfortunately have many familial responsibilities to cover in the day.
          We were able to raise money through selling T-shirts, getting donations, and asking different organizations to help sponsor future events.
